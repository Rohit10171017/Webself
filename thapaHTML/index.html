  <h1>HOW TO USE AI EFFECTIVELY FOR DEVELOPMENT</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>
    Artificial Intelligence is becoming one of the most powerful tools in
    modern development, but using it effectively requires a clear
    understanding of both its <strong>strengths</strong> and its limitations. AI can help
    developers by generating code snippets, debugging errors, improving
    efficiency, and <s>even suggesting new approaches to complex problems</s>. It
    saves time on repetitive or boilerplate tasks, allowing developers to
    focus on creativity, design, and solving real-world challenges. However,
    relying too heavily on <mark style="color: red;">AI without reviewing its output can lead to issues
    such as inefficient solutions, security vulnerabilities, or logical errors
    that go unnoticed .</mark> Effective use of AI means treating it as an assistant
    rather than a replacement for human thinking. A good developer verifies
    and tests everything AI produces, learning from it instead of blindly
    copying results. This combination of human judgment with AI-powered
    <u>support leads to faster development, cleaner code, and more innovative</u>
    projects. In the long run, the developers who benefit most from AI will be
    the ones who use it wisely, blending automation with critical thinking and
    strong fundamentals.
